# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-benign-or-malignant-
This project implements a deep learning–based classification model to predict breast cancer malignancy using clinical diagnostic features. The dataset was preprocessed and modeled using an artificial neural network to distinguish between malignant and benign cases. The model achieved 92% classification accuracy, demonstrating the practical application of AI in healthcare analytics.
